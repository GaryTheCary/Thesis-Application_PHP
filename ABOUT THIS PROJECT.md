This is the web application I designed and developed for my thesis project "My Heels Are Better Than yours". 
The thesis project is about to design and developed a in-shoe system for minimizing the discomfort of wearing fashion high heels.
The web application is designed to recieve pressure data from a 3D printed wearable shoes, which has a particle photon embedded (WIFI Moudle).
The application then process such data and visulized them in area chart and heatmap. The visulization is developed within the help of D3.js.
This application also allow users to change the heel height and see the change of CoP (center of pressure) to determine the correctness of 
subjects' guesture in real-time.

This application also allow users to send customized messages to the client application (developed in Python).

This application is designed and developed in Laravel.
